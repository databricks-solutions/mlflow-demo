## üîß Phase 4: Environment Setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **STOP**: Only proceed if you've completed Phase 3 for your chosen deployment mode.

Run these commands in order from the project root directory:

### 4.1 Setup Environment & Configure Environment Variables

```bash
./setup.sh
```

**What this script does:**
1. **Checks prerequisites** - Validates Python ‚â•3.10.16, uv, Databricks CLI ‚â•0.262.0, and bun
2. **Installs missing tools** - Automatically installs uv and bun if not present (asks for confirmation first)
3. **Configures environment** - Prompts you for deployment mode and configuration
4. **Installs dependencies** - Sets up Python packages with uv and frontend packages with bun

**What the script will ask for:**
- Your deployment mode choice (full app vs notebook-only)
- App name (if full deployment) or workspace path (if notebook-only)
- MLflow experiment ID (from Phase 1 prerequisites)
- Unity Catalog schema information
- LLM model selection

### 4.2 Load Sample Data

```bash
./load_sample_data.sh
```

**Both deployment modes get:**
- ‚úÖ MLflow experiment with sample data
- ‚úÖ Evaluation datasets and prompts
- ‚úÖ Trace examples and monitoring setup
- ‚úÖ Sample customer data for the demo

### 4.3 Test Local Development Server

```bash
./watch.sh
```

- Starts both backend (port 8000) and frontend development servers
- Visit `http://localhost:8000` to verify the demo works locally
- **Success criteria**: You should see the email generation interface and be able to generate emails

### ‚úÖ Environment Setup Checkpoint

Verify your setup:

- [ ] Environment variables configured successfully
- [ ] Sample data loaded without errors
- [ ] Local server runs and demo interface loads
- [ ] Can generate emails locally (test the core functionality)

---

## üöÄ Phase 5: Deployment

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **STOP**: Only proceed if Phase 4 completed successfully and you can generate emails locally.

### 5.1 Deploy Based on Your Mode

#### For Full App Deployment:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only follow this section if you chose Full Databricks App in Phase 2**

##### Configure App Permissions (Before Deployment)

Your Databricks App needs specific permissions to access the MLflow experiment and other resources.

**Get Your App's Service Principal:**

1. Go to your Databricks workspace ‚Üí Compute ‚Üí Apps
2. Find your app and click on it
3. Go to the **Authorization** tab
4. **Copy the service principal name** (you'll need this for the next steps)

**Grant Required Permissions:**

**MLflow Experiment Access:**
- [ ] Go to your MLflow experiment ‚Üí Permissions tab
- [ ] Grant **CAN MANAGE** (or higher) to your app's service principal
- [ ] This enables tracing and demo functionality

**Unity Catalog Schema Access:**
- [ ] Go to your Unity Catalog schema ‚Üí Permissions tab
- [ ] Grant **ALL PERMISSIONS** to your app's service principal
- [ ] Grant **MANAGE** to your app's service principal
- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: You need BOTH permissions - ALL does not include MANAGE
- [ ] This enables the prompt registry functionality

**Model Serving Endpoint Access:**
- [ ] Go to the Databricks App
- [ ] Click on **Edit**
- [ ] Click **Next**
- [ ] Click **Add Resource** and choose **Serving Endpoint**
- [ ] Select your model serving endpoint (`databricks-claude-3-7-sonnet` unless you changed the model)
- [ ] Press **Save**
- [ ] This allows the app to call the LLM for email generation

##### Deploy the App

```bash
./deploy.sh
```

**This script will:**
- Package your application code
- Upload it to your Databricks App
- Configure the necessary environment variables
- Start the app in your Databricks workspace

#### For Notebook-Only Deployment:

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Only follow this section if you chose Notebooks Only in Phase 2**

##### Sync Notebooks to Workspace

```bash
./deploy.sh --sync-only
```

**This script will:**
- Sync notebooks to your workspace location
- Skip app deployment steps
- Provide direct notebook URLs for easy access
- Configure MLflow experiment automatically

### 5.2 Verify Your Deployment
